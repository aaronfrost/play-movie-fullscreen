# play-movie-fullscreen
The movie player on play.google.com/movies only takes up part of the screen. 
This extension make it take as much spaces as possible. This is great cause 
you get a bigger player, without having to click "FULLSCREEN" which does weird 
shiz in MacOS. 

Here is the affect of the Play Movie Fullscreen extension
